# ❤️ Heart Stroke Prediction

A simple, interactive **Streamlit** web application that predicts the risk of heart
disease based on patient health parameters — age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG
results, and more — using a pre-trained **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.

🔗 **Live App:**([https://heart-stroke-prediction.streamlit.app](https://heart-stroke-predic-tion.streamlit.app/))

## 🚀 Features

- Clean, dark-themed UI built with Streamlit
- Form-based input (no reruns on every slider tick)
- One-hot encoding handled automatically to match the model's expected columns
- Feature scaling applied before prediction
- Risk result shown as a styled card (High Risk / Low Risk)
- Approximate confidence score derived from the SVM decision margin
- Expandable explanation of what the "margin" means

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/heart-stroke-prediction.git
   cd heart-stroke-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet, create one with:
   ```
   streamlit
   pandas
   scikit-learn
   joblib
   ```

4. **Ensure model files are present**
   Make sure `SVM_heart.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, and `Columns.pkl` are in the same
   directory as `heart_stroke_app.py`.

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run heart_stroke_app.py
   ```

6. Open the local URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Fill in the patient details in the form — age, sex, chest pain type, resting
   blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate,
   exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and ST slope.
2. Click **🔍 Predict**.
3. View the risk result (High Risk / Low Risk) along with the model's decision
   margin and an approximate confidence percentage.

## 🔍 Model Notes

- The model was trained **without** probability estimates enabled
  (`probability=False`), so `predict_proba` is not available.
- Instead, the app uses `decision_function()` to get the signed distance from the
  separating hyperplane, which is shown as an approximate confidence score.
  This is a rough indicator of model certainty — **not** a calibrated probability.
